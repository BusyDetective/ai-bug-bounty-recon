"""
Endpoint Intelligence Engine v2.0

Analyzes endpoints for security-relevant patterns.
Fixes:
- UUID detection was unreachable (code after return statement)
- Every /api/ and /user/ URL was flagged HIGH = massive false positive noise
- No confidence scoring — every finding treated equally
- analyze_all() returned tuples, losing severity/reason context

Now returns structured findings with confidence levels,
only flags genuinely suspicious patterns.
